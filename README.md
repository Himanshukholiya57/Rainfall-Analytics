# Rainfall Analytics

A Python-based data analysis project for analyzing rainfall patterns across different regions of India.

## Overview

This project provides tools for analyzing and visualizing rainfall data across various subdivisions in India. It includes features for trend analysis, seasonal variability assessment, and statistical comparisons between different regions.

## Features

- Annual rainfall trend analysis by subdivision
- Seasonal rainfall variability analysis
- Coastal vs Inland rainfall comparison
- Food-producing regions rainfall distribution analysis
- Rainfall anomaly detection
- Statistical significance testing for regional rainfall differences

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- statsmodels

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Rainfall-Analytics.git
cd Rainfall-Analytics
```

2. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels
```

## Usage

1. Place your rainfall data CSV file in the project directory
2. Run the main script:
```bash
python rainfall.py
```

The script will:
- Load and clean the rainfall data
- Generate various visualizations
- Perform statistical analyses
- Display results and plots

## Data Analysis

The project performs the following analyses:

1. **Annual Rainfall Trends**: Visualizes rainfall patterns over time for selected subdivisions
2. **Seasonal Variability**: Analyzes rainfall distribution across different seasons
3. **Regional Comparisons**: Compares rainfall patterns between coastal and inland regions
4. **Food-Producing Regions**: Examines rainfall distribution in major agricultural areas
5. **Rainfall Anomalies**: Detects and visualizes unusual rainfall patterns
6. **Statistical Testing**: Performs significance tests for regional rainfall differences

## Output

The script generates several visualizations:
- Line plots for annual trends
- Bar plots for seasonal analysis
- Scatter plots for regional comparisons
- Box plots for distribution analysis
- Heatmaps for anomaly detection
